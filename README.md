# zBoilerplates
Quick boilerplates to use. 

Just clone the repo and start using index.htm to build your next quick app/page.

## Bower version:
Uses Bootstrap 3, Paper Material Theme, AngularJS, ngFx.

## CDN version:
Ready to use `index-cdn.htm` that uses CDNJS and should run without anything more than copying the file. That version also has some more functions to let you use the beautiful vex as the main component for alerts/confirms. Confirmations can either execute Angular, vanilla JS or jQuery.

Contributions are more than welcomed.
